# MCP Server Development Guide

## Overview

Create MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers that enable LLMs to interact with external services through well-designed tools. The quality of an MCP server is measured by how well it enables LLMs to accomplish real-world tasks.

---

# Process

## 🚀 High-Level Workflow

Creating a high-quality MCP server involves four main phases:

### Phase 1: Deep Research and Planning

#### 1.1 Understand Modern MCP Design

**API Coverage vs. Workflow Tools:**
Balance comprehensive API endpoint coverage with specialized workflow tools. Workflow tools can be more convenient for specific tasks, while comprehensive coverage gives agents flexibility to compose operations. Performance varies by client—some clients benefit from code execution that combines basic tools, while others work better with higher-level workflows. When uncertain, prioritize comprehensive API coverage.

**Tool Naming and Discoverability:**
Clear, descriptive tool names help agents find the right tools quickly. Use consistent prefixes (e.g., `github_create_issue`, `github_list_repos`) and action-oriented naming.

**Context Management:**
Agents benefit from concise tool descriptions and the ability to filter/paginate results. Design tools that return focused, relevant data. Some clients support code execution which can help agents filter and process data efficiently.

**Actionable Error Messages:**
Error messages should guide agents toward solutions with specific suggestions and next steps.

#### 1.2 Study MCP Protocol Documentation

**Navigate the MCP specification:**

Start with the sitemap to find relevant pages: `https://modelcontextprotocol.io/sitemap.xml`

Then fetch specific pages with `.md` suffix for markdown format (e.g., `https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/draft.md`).

Key pages to review:
- Specification overview and architecture
- Transport mechanisms (streamable HTTP, stdio)
- Tool, resource, and prompt definitions

#### 1.3 Study Framework Documentation

**Recommended stack:**
- **Language**: TypeScript (high-quality SDK support and good compatibility in many execution environments e.g. MCPB. Plus AI models are good at generating TypeScript code, benefiting from its broad usage, static typing and good linting tools)
- **Transport**: Streamable HTTP for remote servers, using stateless JSON (simpler to scale and maintain, as opposed to stateful sessions and streaming responses). stdio for local servers.

**Load framework documentation:**

- **MCP Best Practices**: [📋 View Best Practices](./reference/mcp_best_practices.md) - Core guidelines

**For TypeScript (recommended):**
- **TypeScript SDK**: Use WebFetch to load `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk/main/README.md`
- [⚡ TypeScript Guide](./reference/node_mcp_server.md) - TypeScript patterns and examples

**For Python:**
- **Python SDK**: Use WebFetch to load `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk/main/README.md`
- [🐍 Python Guide](./reference/python_mcp_server.md) - Python patterns and examples

#### 1.4 Plan Your Implementation

**Understand the API:**
Review the service's API documentation to identify key endpoints, authentication requirements, and data models. Use web search and WebFetch as needed.

**Tool Selection:**
Prioritize comprehensive API coverage. List endpoints to implement, starting with the most common operations.

---

### Phase 2: Implementation

#### 2.1 Set Up Project Structure

See language-specific guides for project setup:
- [⚡ TypeScript Guide](./reference/node_mcp_server.md) - Project structure, package.json, tsconfig.json
- [🐍 Python Guide](./reference/python_mcp_server.md) - Module organization, dependencies

#### 2.2 Implement Core Infrastructure

Create shared utilities:
- API client with authentication
- Error handling helpers
- Response formatting (JSON/Markdown)
- Pagination support

#### 2.3 Implement Tools

For each tool:

**Input Schema:**
- Use Zod (TypeScript) or Pydantic (Python)
- Include constraints and clear descriptions
- Add examples in field descriptions

**Output Schema:**
- Define `outputSchema` where possible for structured data
- Use `structuredContent` in tool responses (TypeScript SDK feature)
- Helps clients understand and process tool outputs

**Tool Description:**
- Concise summary of functionality
- Parameter descriptions
- Return type schema

**Implementation:**
- Async/await for I/O operations
- Proper error handling with actionable messages
- Support pagination where applicable
- Return both text content and structured data when using modern SDKs

**Annotations:**
- `readOnlyHint`: true/false
- `destructiveHint`: true/false
- `idempotentHint`: true/false
- `openWorldHint`: true/false

---

### Phase 3: Review and Test

#### 3.1 Code Quality

Review for:
- No duplicated code (DRY principle)
- Consistent error handling
- Full type coverage
- Clear tool descriptions

#### 3.2 Build and Test

**TypeScript:**
- Run `npm run build` to verify compilation
- Test with MCP Inspector: `npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector`

**Python:**
- Verify syntax: `python -m py_compile your_server.py`
- Test with MCP Inspector

See language-specific guides for detailed testing approaches and quality checklists.

---

### Phase 4: Create Evaluations

After implementing your MCP server, create comprehensive evaluations to test its effectiveness.

**Load [✅ Evaluation Guide](./reference/evaluation.md) for complete evaluation guidelines.**

#### 4.1 Understand Evaluation Purpose

Use evaluations to test whether LLMs can effectively use your MCP server to answer realistic, complex questions.

#### 4.2 Create 10 Evaluation Questions

To create effective evaluations, follow the process outlined in the evaluation guide:

1. **Tool Inspection**: List available tools and understand their capabilities
2. **Content Exploration**: Use READ-ONLY operations to explore available data
3. **Question Generation**: Create 10 complex, realistic questions
4. **Answer Verification**: Solve each question yourself to verify answers

#### 4.3 Evaluation Requirements

Ensure each question is:
- **Independent**: Not dependent on other questions
- **Read-only**: Only non-destructive operations required
- **Complex**: Requiring multiple tool calls and deep exploration
- **Realistic**: Based on real use cases humans would care about
- **Verifiable**: Single, clear answer that can be verified by string comparison
- **Stable**: Answer won't change over time

#### 4.4 Output Format

Create an XML file with this structure:

```xml
<evaluation>
  <qa_pair>
    <question>Find discussions about AI model launches with animal codenames. One model needed a specific safety designation that uses the format ASL-X. What number X was being determined for the model named after a spotted wild cat?</question>
    <answer>3</answer>
  </qa_pair>
<!-- More qa_pairs... -->
</evaluation>
```

# MCP Server Evaluation Guide

## Overview

This document provides guidance on creating comprehensive evaluations for MCP servers. Evaluations test whether LLMs can effectively use your MCP server to answer realistic, complex questions using only the tools provided.

---

## Quick Reference

### Evaluation Requirements
- Create 10 human-readable questions
- Questions must be READ-ONLY, INDEPENDENT, NON-DESTRUCTIVE
- Each question requires multiple tool calls (potentially dozens)
- Answers must be single, verifiable values
- Answers must be STABLE (won't change over time)

### Output Format
```xml
<evaluation>
   <qa_pair>
      <question>Your question here</question>
      <answer>Single verifiable answer</answer>
   </qa_pair>
</evaluation>
```

---

## Purpose of Evaluations

The measure of quality of an MCP server is NOT how well or comprehensively the server implements tools, but how well these implementations (input/output schemas, docstrings/descriptions, functionality) enable LLMs with no other context and access ONLY to the MCP servers to answer realistic and difficult questions.

## Evaluation Overview

Create 10 human-readable questions requiring ONLY READ-ONLY, INDEPENDENT, NON-DESTRUCTIVE, and IDEMPOTENT operations to answer. Each question should be:
- Realistic
- Clear and concise
- Unambiguous
- Complex, requiring potentially dozens of tool calls or steps
- Answerable with a single, verifiable value that you identify in advance

## Question Guidelines

### Core Requirements

1. **Questions MUST be independent**
   - Each question should NOT depend on the answer to any other question
   - Should not assume prior write operations from processing another question

2. **Questions MUST require ONLY NON-DESTRUCTIVE AND IDEMPOTENT tool use**
   - Should not instruct or require modifying state to arrive at the correct answer

3. **Questions must be REALISTIC, CLEAR, CONCISE, and COMPLEX**
   - Must require another LLM to use multiple (potentially dozens of) tools or steps to answer

### Complexity and Depth

4. **Questions must require deep exploration**
   - Consider multi-hop questions requiring multiple sub-questions and sequential tool calls
   - Each step should benefit from information found in previous questions

5. **Questions may require extensive paging**
   - May need paging through multiple pages of results
   - May require querying old data (1-2 years out-of-date) to find niche information
   - The questions must be DIFFICULT

6. **Questions must require deep understanding**
   - Rather than surface-level knowledge
   - May pose complex ideas as True/False questions requiring evidence
   - May use multiple-choice format where LLM must search different hypotheses

7. **Questions must not be solvable with straightforward keyword search**
   - Do not include specific keywords from the target content
   - Use synonyms, related concepts, or paraphrases
   - Require multiple searches, analyzing multiple related items, extracting context, then deriving the answer

### Tool Testing

8. **Questions should stress-test tool return values**
   - May elicit tools returning large JSON objects or lists, overwhelming the LLM
   - Should require understanding multiple modalities of data:
     - IDs and names
     - Timestamps and datetimes (months, days, years, seconds)
     - File IDs, names, extensions, and mimetypes
     - URLs, GIDs, etc.
   - Should probe the tool's ability to return all useful forms of data

9. **Questions should MOSTLY reflect real human use cases**
   - The kinds of information retrieval tasks that HUMANS assisted by an LLM would care about

10. **Questions may require dozens of tool calls**
    - This challenges LLMs with limited context
    - Encourages MCP server tools to reduce information returned

11. **Include ambiguous questions**
    - May be ambiguous OR require difficult decisions on which tools to call
    - Force the LLM to potentially make mistakes or misinterpret
    - Ensure that despite AMBIGUITY, there is STILL A SINGLE VERIFIABLE ANSWER

### Stability

12. **Questions must be designed so the answer DOES NOT CHANGE**
    - Do not ask questions that rely on "current state" which is dynamic
    - For example, do not count:
      - Number of reactions to a post
      - Number of replies to a thread
      - Number of members in a channel

13. **DO NOT let the MCP server RESTRICT the kinds of questions you create**
    - Create challenging and complex questions
    - Some may not be solvable with the available MCP server tools
    - Questions may require specific output formats (datetime vs. epoch time, JSON vs. MARKDOWN)
    - Questions may require dozens of tool calls to complete

## Answer Guidelines

### Verification

1. **Answers must be VERIFIABLE via direct string comparison**
   - If the answer can be re-written in many formats, clearly specify the output format in the QUESTION
   - Examples: "Use YYYY/MM/DD.", "Respond True or False.", "Answer A, B, C, or D and nothing else."
   - Answer should be a single VERIFIABLE value such as:
     - User ID, user name, display name, first name, last name
     - Channel ID, channel name
     - Message ID, string
     - URL, title
     - Numerical quantity
     - Timestamp, datetime
     - Boolean (for True/False questions)
     - Email address, phone number
     - File ID, file name, file extension
     - Multiple choice answer
   - Answers must not require special formatting or complex, structured output
   - Answer will be verified using DIRECT STRING COMPARISON

### Readability

2. **Answers should generally prefer HUMAN-READABLE formats**
   - Examples: names, first name, last name, datetime, file name, message string, URL, yes/no, true/false, a/b/c/d
   - Rather than opaque IDs (though IDs are acceptable)
   - The VAST MAJORITY of answers should be human-readable

### Stability

3. **Answers must be STABLE/STATIONARY**
   - Look at old content (e.g., conversations that have ended, projects that have launched, questions answered)
   - Create QUESTIONS based on "closed" concepts that will always return the same answer
   - Questions may ask to consider a fixed time window to insulate from non-stationary answers
   - Rely on context UNLIKELY to change
   - Example: if finding a paper name, be SPECIFIC enough so answer is not confused with papers published later

4. **Answers must be CLEAR and UNAMBIGUOUS**
   - Questions must be designed so there is a single, clear answer
   - Answer can be derived from using the MCP server tools

### Diversity

5. **Answers must be DIVERSE**
   - Answer should be a single VERIFIABLE value in diverse modalities and formats
   - User concept: user ID, user name, display name, first name, last name, email address, phone number
   - Channel concept: channel ID, channel name, channel topic
   - Message concept: message ID, message string, timestamp, month, day, year

6. **Answers must NOT be complex structures**
   - Not a list of values
   - Not a complex object
   - Not a list of IDs or strings
   - Not natural language text
   - UNLESS the answer can be straightforwardly verified using DIRECT STRING COMPARISON
   - And can be realistically reproduced
   - It should be unlikely that an LLM would return the same list in any other order or format

## Evaluation Process

### Step 1: Documentation Inspection

Read the documentation of the target API to understand:
- Available endpoints and functionality
- If ambiguity exists, fetch additional information from the web
- Parallelize this step AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE
- Ensure each subagent is ONLY examining documentation from the file system or on the web

### Step 2: Tool Inspection

List the tools available in the MCP server:
- Inspect the MCP server directly
- Understand input/output schemas, docstrings, and descriptions
- WITHOUT calling the tools themselves at this stage

### Step 3: Developing Understanding

Repeat steps 1 & 2 until you have a good understanding:
- Iterate multiple times
- Think about the kinds of tasks you want to create
- Refine your understanding
- At NO stage should you READ the code of the MCP server implementation itself
- Use your intuition and understanding to create reasonable, realistic, but VERY challenging tasks

### Step 4: Read-Only Content Inspection

After understanding the API and tools, USE the MCP server tools:
- Inspect content using READ-ONLY and NON-DESTRUCTIVE operations ONLY
- Goal: identify specific content (e.g., users, channels, messages, projects, tasks) for creating realistic questions
- Should NOT call any tools that modify state
- Will NOT read the code of the MCP server implementation itself
- Parallelize this step with individual sub-agents pursuing independent explorations
- Ensure each subagent is only performing READ-ONLY, NON-DESTRUCTIVE, and IDEMPOTENT operations
- BE CAREFUL: SOME TOOLS may return LOTS OF DATA which would cause you to run out of CONTEXT
- Make INCREMENTAL, SMALL, AND TARGETED tool calls for exploration
- In all tool call requests, use the `limit` parameter to limit results (<10)
- Use pagination

### Step 5: Task Generation

After inspecting the content, create 10 human-readable questions:
- An LLM should be able to answer these with the MCP server
- Follow all question and answer guidelines above

## Output Format

Each QA pair consists of a question and an answer. The output should be an XML file with this structure:

```xml
<evaluation>
   <qa_pair>
      <question>Find the project created in Q2 2024 with the highest number of completed tasks. What is the project name?</question>
      <answer>Website Redesign</answer>
   </qa_pair>
   <qa_pair>
      <question>Search for issues labeled as "bug" that were closed in March 2024. Which user closed the most issues? Provide their username.</question>
      <answer>sarah_dev</answer>
   </qa_pair>
   <qa_pair>
      <question>Look for pull requests that modified files in the /api directory and were merged between January 1 and January 31, 2024. How many different contributors worked on these PRs?</question>
      <answer>7</answer>
   </qa_pair>
   <qa_pair>
      <question>Find the repository with the most stars that was created before 2023. What is the repository name?</question>
      <answer>data-pipeline</answer>
   </qa_pair>
</evaluation>
```

## Evaluation Examples

### Good Questions

**Example 1: Multi-hop question requiring deep exploration (GitHub MCP)**
```xml
<qa_pair>
   <question>Find the repository that was archived in Q3 2023 and had previously been the most forked project in the organization. What was the primary programming language used in that repository?</question>
   <answer>Python</answer>
</qa_pair>
```

This question is good because:
- Requires multiple searches to find archived repositories
- Needs to identify which had the most forks before archival
- Requires examining repository details for the language
- Answer is a simple, verifiable value
- Based on historical (closed) data that won't change

**Example 2: Requires understanding context without keyword matching (Project Management MCP)**
```xml
<qa_pair>
   <question>Locate the initiative focused on improving customer onboarding that was completed in late 2023. The project lead created a retrospective document after completion. What was the lead's role title at that time?</question>
   <answer>Product Manager</answer>
</qa_pair>
```

This question is good because:
- Doesn't use specific project name ("initiative focused on improving customer onboarding")
- Requires finding completed projects from specific timeframe
- Needs to identify the project lead and their role
- Requires understanding context from retrospective documents
- Answer is human-readable and stable
- Based on completed work (won't change)

**Example 3: Complex aggregation requiring multiple steps (Issue Tracker MCP)**
```xml
<qa_pair>
   <question>Among all bugs reported in January 2024 that were marked as critical priority, which assignee resolved the highest percentage of their assigned bugs within 48 hours? Provide the assignee's username.</question>
   <answer>alex_eng</answer>
</qa_pair>
```

This question is good because:
- Requires filtering bugs by date, priority, and status
- Needs to group by assignee and calculate resolution rates
- Requires understanding timestamps to determine 48-hour windows
- Tests pagination (potentially many bugs to process)
- Answer is a single username
- Based on historical data from specific time period

**Example 4: Requires synthesis across multiple data types (CRM MCP)**
```xml
<qa_pair>
   <question>Find the account that upgraded from the Starter to Enterprise plan in Q4 2023 and had the highest annual contract value. What industry does this account operate in?</question>
   <answer>Healthcare</answer>
</qa_pair>
```

This question is good because:
- Requires understanding subscription tier changes
- Needs to identify upgrade events in specific timeframe
- Requires comparing contract values
- Must access account industry information
- Answer is simple and verifiable
- Based on completed historical transactions

### Poor Questions

**Example 1: Answer changes over time**
```xml
<qa_pair>
   <question>How many open issues are currently assigned to the engineering team?</question>
   <answer>47</answer>
</qa_pair>
```

This question is poor because:
- The answer will change as issues are created, closed, or reassigned
- Not based on stable/stationary data
- Relies on "current state" which is dynamic

**Example 2: Too easy with keyword search**
```xml
<qa_pair>
   <question>Find the pull request with title "Add authentication feature" and tell me who created it.</question>
   <answer>developer123</answer>
</qa_pair>
```

This question is poor because:
- Can be solved with a straightforward keyword search for exact title
- Doesn't require deep exploration or understanding
- No synthesis or analysis needed

**Example 3: Ambiguous answer format**
```xml
<qa_pair>
   <question>List all the repositories that have Python as their primary language.</question>
   <answer>repo1, repo2, repo3, data-pipeline, ml-tools</answer>
</qa_pair>
```

This question is poor because:
- Answer is a list that could be returned in any order
- Difficult to verify with direct string comparison
- LLM might format differently (JSON array, comma-separated, newline-separated)
- Better to ask for a specific aggregate (count) or superlative (most stars)

## Verification Process

After creating evaluations:

1. **Examine the XML file** to understand the schema
2. **Load each task instruction** and in parallel using the MCP server and tools, identify the correct answer by attempting to solve the task YOURSELF
3. **Flag any operations** that require WRITE or DESTRUCTIVE operations
4. **Accumulate all CORRECT answers** and replace any incorrect answers in the document
5. **Remove any `<qa_pair>`** that require WRITE or DESTRUCTIVE operations

Remember to parallelize solving tasks to avoid running out of context, then accumulate all answers and make changes to the file at the end.

## Tips for Creating Quality Evaluations

1. **Think Hard and Plan Ahead** before generating tasks
2. **Parallelize Where Opportunity Arises** to speed up the process and manage context
3. **Focus on Realistic Use Cases** that humans would actually want to accomplish
4. **Create Challenging Questions** that test the limits of the MCP server's capabilities
5. **Ensure Stability** by using historical data and closed concepts
6. **Verify Answers** by solving the questions yourself using the MCP server tools
7. **Iterate and Refine** based on what you learn during the process

# Running Evaluations

After creating your evaluation file, you can use the provided evaluation harness to test your MCP server.

## Setup

1. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r scripts/requirements.txt
   ```

   Or install manually:
   ```bash
   pip install anthropic mcp
   ```

2. **Set API Key**

   ```bash
   export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

## Evaluation File Format

Evaluation files use XML format with `<qa_pair>` elements:

```xml
<evaluation>
   <qa_pair>
      <question>Find the project created in Q2 2024 with the highest number of completed tasks. What is the project name?</question>
      <answer>Website Redesign</answer>
   </qa_pair>
   <qa_pair>
      <question>Search for issues labeled as "bug" that were closed in March 2024. Which user closed the most issues? Provide their username.</question>
      <answer>sarah_dev</answer>
   </qa_pair>
</evaluation>
```

## Running Evaluations

The evaluation script (`scripts/evaluation.py`) supports three transport types:

**Important:**
- **stdio transport**: The evaluation script automatically launches and manages the MCP server process for you. Do not run the server manually.
- **sse/http transports**: You must start the MCP server separately before running the evaluation. The script connects to the already-running server at the specified URL.

### 1. Local STDIO Server

For locally-run MCP servers (script launches the server automatically):

```bash
python scripts/evaluation.py \
  -t stdio \
  -c python \
  -a my_mcp_server.py \
  evaluation.xml
```

With environment variables:
```bash
python scripts/evaluation.py \
  -t stdio \
  -c python \
  -a my_mcp_server.py \
  -e API_KEY=abc123 \
  -e DEBUG=true \
  evaluation.xml
```

### 2. Server-Sent Events (SSE)

For SSE-based MCP servers (you must start the server first):

```bash
python scripts/evaluation.py \
  -t sse \
  -u https://example.com/mcp \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer token123" \
  -H "X-Custom-Header: value" \
  evaluation.xml
```

### 3. HTTP (Streamable HTTP)

For HTTP-based MCP servers (you must start the server first):

```bash
python scripts/evaluation.py \
  -t http \
  -u https://example.com/mcp \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer token123" \
  evaluation.xml
```

## Command-Line Options

```
usage: evaluation.py [-h] [-t {stdio,sse,http}] [-m MODEL] [-c COMMAND]
                     [-a ARGS [ARGS ...]] [-e ENV [ENV ...]] [-u URL]
                     [-H HEADERS [HEADERS ...]] [-o OUTPUT]
                     eval_file

positional arguments:
  eval_file             Path to evaluation XML file

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            Show help message
  -t, --transport       Transport type: stdio, sse, or http (default: stdio)
  -m, --model           Claude model to use (default: claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219)
  -o, --output          Output file for report (default: print to stdout)

stdio options:
  -c, --command         Command to run MCP server (e.g., python, node)
  -a, --args            Arguments for the command (e.g., server.py)
  -e, --env             Environment variables in KEY=VALUE format

sse/http options:
  -u, --url             MCP server URL
  -H, --header          HTTP headers in 'Key: Value' format
```

## Output

The evaluation script generates a detailed report including:

- **Summary Statistics**:
  - Accuracy (correct/total)
  - Average task duration
  - Average tool calls per task
  - Total tool calls

- **Per-Task Results**:
  - Prompt and expected response
  - Actual response from the agent
  - Whether the answer was correct (✅/❌)
  - Duration and tool call details
  - Agent's summary of its approach
  - Agent's feedback on the tools

### Save Report to File

```bash
python scripts/evaluation.py \
  -t stdio \
  -c python \
  -a my_server.py \
  -o evaluation_report.md \
  evaluation.xml
```

## Complete Example Workflow

Here's a complete example of creating and running an evaluation:

1. **Create your evaluation file** (`my_evaluation.xml`):

```xml
<evaluation>
   <qa_pair>
      <question>Find the user who created the most issues in January 2024. What is their username?</question>
      <answer>alice_developer</answer>
   </qa_pair>
   <qa_pair>
      <question>Among all pull requests merged in Q1 2024, which repository had the highest number? Provide the repository name.</question>
      <answer>backend-api</answer>
   </qa_pair>
   <qa_pair>
      <question>Find the project that was completed in December 2023 and had the longest duration from start to finish. How many days did it take?</question>
      <answer>127</answer>
   </qa_pair>
</evaluation>
```

2. **Install dependencies**:

```bash
pip install -r scripts/requirements.txt
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_api_key
```

3. **Run evaluation**:

```bash
python scripts/evaluation.py \
  -t stdio \
  -c python \
  -a github_mcp_server.py \
  -e GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_xxx \
  -o github_eval_report.md \
  my_evaluation.xml
```

4. **Review the report** in `github_eval_report.md` to:
   - See which questions passed/failed
   - Read the agent's feedback on your tools
   - Identify areas for improvement
   - Iterate on your MCP server design

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Errors

If you get connection errors:
- **STDIO**: Verify the command and arguments are correct
- **SSE/HTTP**: Check the URL is accessible and headers are correct
- Ensure any required API keys are set in environment variables or headers

### Low Accuracy

If many evaluations fail:
- Review the agent's feedback for each task
- Check if tool descriptions are clear and comprehensive
- Verify input parameters are well-documented
- Consider whether tools return too much or too little data
- Ensure error messages are actionable

### Timeout Issues

If tasks are timing out:
- Use a more capable model (e.g., `claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219`)
- Check if tools are returning too much data
- Verify pagination is working correctly
- Consider simplifying complex questions

# MCP Server Best Practices

## Quick Reference

### Server Naming
- **Python**: `{service}_mcp` (e.g., `slack_mcp`)
- **Node/TypeScript**: `{service}-mcp-server` (e.g., `slack-mcp-server`)

### Tool Naming
- Use snake_case with service prefix
- Format: `{service}_{action}_{resource}`
- Example: `slack_send_message`, `github_create_issue`

### Response Formats
- Support both JSON and Markdown formats
- JSON for programmatic processing
- Markdown for human readability

### Pagination
- Always respect `limit` parameter
- Return `has_more`, `next_offset`, `total_count`
- Default to 20-50 items

### Transport
- **Streamable HTTP**: For remote servers, multi-client scenarios
- **stdio**: For local integrations, command-line tools
- Avoid SSE (deprecated in favor of streamable HTTP)

---

## Server Naming Conventions

Follow these standardized naming patterns:

**Python**: Use format `{service}_mcp` (lowercase with underscores)
- Examples: `slack_mcp`, `github_mcp`, `jira_mcp`

**Node/TypeScript**: Use format `{service}-mcp-server` (lowercase with hyphens)
- Examples: `slack-mcp-server`, `github-mcp-server`, `jira-mcp-server`

The name should be general, descriptive of the service being integrated, easy to infer from the task description, and without version numbers.

---

## Tool Naming and Design

### Tool Naming

1. **Use snake_case**: `search_users`, `create_project`, `get_channel_info`
2. **Include service prefix**: Anticipate that your MCP server may be used alongside other MCP servers
   - Use `slack_send_message` instead of just `send_message`
   - Use `github_create_issue` instead of just `create_issue`
3. **Be action-oriented**: Start with verbs (get, list, search, create, etc.)
4. **Be specific**: Avoid generic names that could conflict with other servers

### Tool Design

- Tool descriptions must narrowly and unambiguously describe functionality
- Descriptions must precisely match actual functionality
- Provide tool annotations (readOnlyHint, destructiveHint, idempotentHint, openWorldHint)
- Keep tool operations focused and atomic

---

## Response Formats

All tools that return data should support multiple formats:

### JSON Format (`response_format="json"`)
- Machine-readable structured data
- Include all available fields and metadata
- Consistent field names and types
- Use for programmatic processing

### Markdown Format (`response_format="markdown"`, typically default)
- Human-readable formatted text
- Use headers, lists, and formatting for clarity
- Convert timestamps to human-readable format
- Show display names with IDs in parentheses
- Omit verbose metadata

---

## Pagination

For tools that list resources:

- **Always respect the `limit` parameter**
- **Implement pagination**: Use `offset` or cursor-based pagination
- **Return pagination metadata**: Include `has_more`, `next_offset`/`next_cursor`, `total_count`
- **Never load all results into memory**: Especially important for large datasets
- **Default to reasonable limits**: 20-50 items is typical

Example pagination response:
```json
{
  "total": 150,
  "count": 20,
  "offset": 0,
  "items": [...],
  "has_more": true,
  "next_offset": 20
}
```

---

## Transport Options

### Streamable HTTP

**Best for**: Remote servers, web services, multi-client scenarios

**Characteristics**:
- Bidirectional communication over HTTP
- Supports multiple simultaneous clients
- Can be deployed as a web service
- Enables server-to-client notifications

**Use when**:
- Serving multiple clients simultaneously
- Deploying as a cloud service
- Integration with web applications

### stdio

**Best for**: Local integrations, command-line tools

**Characteristics**:
- Standard input/output stream communication
- Simple setup, no network configuration needed
- Runs as a subprocess of the client

**Use when**:
- Building tools for local development environments
- Integrating with desktop applications
- Single-user, single-session scenarios

**Note**: stdio servers should NOT log to stdout (use stderr for logging)

### Transport Selection

| Criterion | stdio | Streamable HTTP |
|-----------|-------|-----------------|
| **Deployment** | Local | Remote |
| **Clients** | Single | Multiple |
| **Complexity** | Low | Medium |
| **Real-time** | No | Yes |

---

## Security Best Practices

### Authentication and Authorization

**OAuth 2.1**:
- Use secure OAuth 2.1 with certificates from recognized authorities
- Validate access tokens before processing requests
- Only accept tokens specifically intended for your server

**API Keys**:
- Store API keys in environment variables, never in code
- Validate keys on server startup
- Provide clear error messages when authentication fails

### Input Validation

- Sanitize file paths to prevent directory traversal
- Validate URLs and external identifiers
- Check parameter sizes and ranges
- Prevent command injection in system calls
- Use schema validation (Pydantic/Zod) for all inputs

### Error Handling

- Don't expose internal errors to clients
- Log security-relevant errors server-side
- Provide helpful but not revealing error messages
- Clean up resources after errors

### DNS Rebinding Protection

For streamable HTTP servers running locally:
- Enable DNS rebinding protection
- Validate the `Origin` header on all incoming connections
- Bind to `127.0.0.1` rather than `0.0.0.0`

---

## Tool Annotations

Provide annotations to help clients understand tool behavior:

| Annotation | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `readOnlyHint` | boolean | false | Tool does not modify its environment |
| `destructiveHint` | boolean | true | Tool may perform destructive updates |
| `idempotentHint` | boolean | false | Repeated calls with same args have no additional effect |
| `openWorldHint` | boolean | true | Tool interacts with external entities |

**Important**: Annotations are hints, not security guarantees. Clients should not make security-critical decisions based solely on annotations.

---

## Error Handling

- Use standard JSON-RPC error codes
- Report tool errors within result objects (not protocol-level errors)
- Provide helpful, specific error messages with suggested next steps
- Don't expose internal implementation details
- Clean up resources properly on errors

Example error handling:
```typescript
try {
  const result = performOperation();
  return { content: [{ type: "text", text: result }] };
} catch (error) {
  return {
    isError: true,
    content: [{
      type: "text",
      text: `Error: ${error.message}. Try using filter='active_only' to reduce results.`
    }]
  };
}
```

---

## Testing Requirements

Comprehensive testing should cover:

- **Functional testing**: Verify correct execution with valid/invalid inputs
- **Integration testing**: Test interaction with external systems
- **Security testing**: Validate auth, input sanitization, rate limiting
- **Performance testing**: Check behavior under load, timeouts
- **Error handling**: Ensure proper error reporting and cleanup

---

## Documentation Requirements

- Provide clear documentation of all tools and capabilities
- Include working examples (at least 3 per major feature)
- Document security considerations
- Specify required permissions and access levels
- Document rate limits and performance characteristics

```

# Node/TypeScript MCP Server Implementation Guide

## Overview

This document provides Node/TypeScript-specific best practices and examples for implementing MCP servers using the MCP TypeScript SDK. It covers project structure, server setup, tool registration patterns, input validation with Zod, error handling, and complete working examples.

---

## Quick Reference

### Key Imports
```typescript
import { McpServer } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/mcp.js";
import { StreamableHTTPServerTransport } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/streamableHttp.js";
import { StdioServerTransport } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/stdio.js";
import express from "express";
import { z } from "zod";
```

### Server Initialization
```typescript
const server = new McpServer({
  name: "service-mcp-server",
  version: "1.0.0"
});
```

### Tool Registration Pattern
```typescript
server.registerTool(
  "tool_name",
  {
    title: "Tool Display Name",
    description: "What the tool does",
    inputSchema: { param: z.string() },
    outputSchema: { result: z.string() }
  },
  async ({ param }) => {
    const output = { result: `Processed: ${param}` };
    return {
      content: [{ type: "text", text: JSON.stringify(output) }],
      structuredContent: output // Modern pattern for structured data
    };
  }
);
```

---

## MCP TypeScript SDK

The official MCP TypeScript SDK provides:
- `McpServer` class for server initialization
- `registerTool` method for tool registration
- Zod schema integration for runtime input validation
- Type-safe tool handler implementations

**IMPORTANT - Use Modern APIs Only:**
- **DO use**: `server.registerTool()`, `server.registerResource()`, `server.registerPrompt()`
- **DO NOT use**: Old deprecated APIs such as `server.tool()`, `server.setRequestHandler(ListToolsRequestSchema, ...)`, or manual handler registration
- The `register*` methods provide better type safety, automatic schema handling, and are the recommended approach

See the MCP SDK documentation in the references for complete details.

## Server Naming Convention

Node/TypeScript MCP servers must follow this naming pattern:
- **Format**: `{service}-mcp-server` (lowercase with hyphens)
- **Examples**: `github-mcp-server`, `jira-mcp-server`, `stripe-mcp-server`

The name should be:
- General (not tied to specific features)
- Descriptive of the service/API being integrated
- Easy to infer from the task description
- Without version numbers or dates

## Project Structure

Create the following structure for Node/TypeScript MCP servers:

```
{service}-mcp-server/
├── package.json
├── tsconfig.json
├── README.md
├── src/
│   ├── index.ts          # Main entry point with McpServer initialization
│   ├── types.ts          # TypeScript type definitions and interfaces
│   ├── tools/            # Tool implementations (one file per domain)
│   ├── services/         # API clients and shared utilities
│   ├── schemas/          # Zod validation schemas
│   └── constants.ts      # Shared constants (API_URL, CHARACTER_LIMIT, etc.)
└── dist/                 # Built JavaScript files (entry point: dist/index.js)
```

## Tool Implementation

### Tool Naming

Use snake_case for tool names (e.g., "search_users", "create_project", "get_channel_info") with clear, action-oriented names.

**Avoid Naming Conflicts**: Include the service context to prevent overlaps:
- Use "slack_send_message" instead of just "send_message"
- Use "github_create_issue" instead of just "create_issue"
- Use "asana_list_tasks" instead of just "list_tasks"

### Tool Structure

Tools are registered using the `registerTool` method with the following requirements:
- Use Zod schemas for runtime input validation and type safety
- The `description` field must be explicitly provided - JSDoc comments are NOT automatically extracted
- Explicitly provide `title`, `description`, `inputSchema`, and `annotations`
- The `inputSchema` must be a Zod schema object (not a JSON schema)
- Type all parameters and return values explicitly

```typescript
import { McpServer } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/mcp.js";
import { z } from "zod";

const server = new McpServer({
  name: "example-mcp",
  version: "1.0.0"
});

// Zod schema for input validation
const UserSearchInputSchema = z.object({
  query: z.string()
    .min(2, "Query must be at least 2 characters")
    .max(200, "Query must not exceed 200 characters")
    .describe("Search string to match against names/emails"),
  limit: z.number()
    .int()
    .min(1)
    .max(100)
    .default(20)
    .describe("Maximum results to return"),
  offset: z.number()
    .int()
    .min(0)
    .default(0)
    .describe("Number of results to skip for pagination"),
  response_format: z.nativeEnum(ResponseFormat)
    .default(ResponseFormat.MARKDOWN)
    .describe("Output format: 'markdown' for human-readable or 'json' for machine-readable")
}).strict();

// Type definition from Zod schema
type UserSearchInput = z.infer<typeof UserSearchInputSchema>;

server.registerTool(
  "example_search_users",
  {
    title: "Search Example Users",
    description: `Search for users in the Example system by name, email, or team.

This tool searches across all user profiles in the Example platform, supporting partial matches and various search filters. It does NOT create or modify users, only searches existing ones.

Args:
  - query (string): Search string to match against names/emails
  - limit (number): Maximum results to return, between 1-100 (default: 20)
  - offset (number): Number of results to skip for pagination (default: 0)
  - response_format ('markdown' | 'json'): Output format (default: 'markdown')

Returns:
  For JSON format: Structured data with schema:
  {
    "total": number,           // Total number of matches found
    "count": number,           // Number of results in this response
    "offset": number,          // Current pagination offset
    "users": [
      {
        "id": string,          // User ID (e.g., "U123456789")
        "name": string,        // Full name (e.g., "John Doe")
        "email": string,       // Email address
        "team": string,        // Team name (optional)
        "active": boolean      // Whether user is active
      }
    ],
    "has_more": boolean,       // Whether more results are available
    "next_offset": number      // Offset for next page (if has_more is true)
  }

Examples:
  - Use when: "Find all marketing team members" -> params with query="team:marketing"
  - Use when: "Search for John's account" -> params with query="john"
  - Don't use when: You need to create a user (use example_create_user instead)

Error Handling:
  - Returns "Error: Rate limit exceeded" if too many requests (429 status)
  - Returns "No users found matching '<query>'" if search returns empty`,
    inputSchema: UserSearchInputSchema,
    annotations: {
      readOnlyHint: true,
      destructiveHint: false,
      idempotentHint: true,
      openWorldHint: true
    }
  },
  async (params: UserSearchInput) => {
    try {
      // Input validation is handled by Zod schema
      // Make API request using validated parameters
      const data = await makeApiRequest<any>(
        "users/search",
        "GET",
        undefined,
        {
          q: params.query,
          limit: params.limit,
          offset: params.offset
        }
      );

      const users = data.users || [];
      const total = data.total || 0;

      if (!users.length) {
        return {
          content: [{
            type: "text",
            text: `No users found matching '${params.query}'`
          }]
        };
      }

      // Prepare structured output
      const output = {
        total,
        count: users.length,
        offset: params.offset,
        users: users.map((user: any) => ({
          id: user.id,
          name: user.name,
          email: user.email,
          ...(user.team ? { team: user.team } : {}),
          active: user.active ?? true
        })),
        has_more: total > params.offset + users.length,
        ...(total > params.offset + users.length ? {
          next_offset: params.offset + users.length
        } : {})
      };

      // Format text representation based on requested format
      let textContent: string;
      if (params.response_format === ResponseFormat.MARKDOWN) {
        const lines = [`# User Search Results: '${params.query}'`, "",
          `Found ${total} users (showing ${users.length})`, ""];
        for (const user of users) {
          lines.push(`## ${user.name} (${user.id})`);
          lines.push(`- **Email**: ${user.email}`);
          if (user.team) lines.push(`- **Team**: ${user.team}`);
          lines.push("");
        }
        textContent = lines.join("\n");
      } else {
        textContent = JSON.stringify(output, null, 2);
      }

      return {
        content: [{ type: "text", text: textContent }],
        structuredContent: output // Modern pattern for structured data
      };
    } catch (error) {
      return {
        content: [{
          type: "text",
          text: handleApiError(error)
        }]
      };
    }
  }
);
```

## Zod Schemas for Input Validation

Zod provides runtime type validation:

```typescript
import { z } from "zod";

// Basic schema with validation
const CreateUserSchema = z.object({
  name: z.string()
    .min(1, "Name is required")
    .max(100, "Name must not exceed 100 characters"),
  email: z.string()
    .email("Invalid email format"),
  age: z.number()
    .int("Age must be a whole number")
    .min(0, "Age cannot be negative")
    .max(150, "Age cannot be greater than 150")
}).strict();  // Use .strict() to forbid extra fields

// Enums
enum ResponseFormat {
  MARKDOWN = "markdown",
  JSON = "json"
}

const SearchSchema = z.object({
  response_format: z.nativeEnum(ResponseFormat)
    .default(ResponseFormat.MARKDOWN)
    .describe("Output format")
});

// Optional fields with defaults
const PaginationSchema = z.object({
  limit: z.number()
    .int()
    .min(1)
    .max(100)
    .default(20)
    .describe("Maximum results to return"),
  offset: z.number()
    .int()
    .min(0)
    .default(0)
    .describe("Number of results to skip")
});
```

## Response Format Options

Support multiple output formats for flexibility:

```typescript
enum ResponseFormat {
  MARKDOWN = "markdown",
  JSON = "json"
}

const inputSchema = z.object({
  query: z.string(),
  response_format: z.nativeEnum(ResponseFormat)
    .default(ResponseFormat.MARKDOWN)
    .describe("Output format: 'markdown' for human-readable or 'json' for machine-readable")
});
```

**Markdown format**:
- Use headers, lists, and formatting for clarity
- Convert timestamps to human-readable format
- Show display names with IDs in parentheses
- Omit verbose metadata
- Group related information logically

**JSON format**:
- Return complete, structured data suitable for programmatic processing
- Include all available fields and metadata
- Use consistent field names and types

## Pagination Implementation

For tools that list resources:

```typescript
const ListSchema = z.object({
  limit: z.number().int().min(1).max(100).default(20),
  offset: z.number().int().min(0).default(0)
});

async function listItems(params: z.infer<typeof ListSchema>) {
  const data = await apiRequest(params.limit, params.offset);

  const response = {
    total: data.total,
    count: data.items.length,
    offset: params.offset,
    items: data.items,
    has_more: data.total > params.offset + data.items.length,
    next_offset: data.total > params.offset + data.items.length
      ? params.offset + data.items.length
      : undefined
  };

  return JSON.stringify(response, null, 2);
}
```

## Character Limits and Truncation

Add a CHARACTER_LIMIT constant to prevent overwhelming responses:

```typescript
// At module level in constants.ts
export const CHARACTER_LIMIT = 25000;  // Maximum response size in characters

async function searchTool(params: SearchInput) {
  let result = generateResponse(data);

  // Check character limit and truncate if needed
  if (result.length > CHARACTER_LIMIT) {
    const truncatedData = data.slice(0, Math.max(1, data.length / 2));
    response.data = truncatedData;
    response.truncated = true;
    response.truncation_message =
      `Response truncated from ${data.length} to ${truncatedData.length} items. ` +
      `Use 'offset' parameter or add filters to see more results.`;
    result = JSON.stringify(response, null, 2);
  }

  return result;
}
```

## Error Handling

Provide clear, actionable error messages:

```typescript
import axios, { AxiosError } from "axios";

function handleApiError(error: unknown): string {
  if (error instanceof AxiosError) {
    if (error.response) {
      switch (error.response.status) {
        case 404:
          return "Error: Resource not found. Please check the ID is correct.";
        case 403:
          return "Error: Permission denied. You don't have access to this resource.";
        case 429:
          return "Error: Rate limit exceeded. Please wait before making more requests.";
        default:
          return `Error: API request failed with status ${error.response.status}`;
      }
    } else if (error.code === "ECONNABORTED") {
      return "Error: Request timed out. Please try again.";
    }
  }
  return `Error: Unexpected error occurred: ${error instanceof Error ? error.message : String(error)}`;
}
```

## Shared Utilities

Extract common functionality into reusable functions:

```typescript
// Shared API request function
async function makeApiRequest<T>(
  endpoint: string,
  method: "GET" | "POST" | "PUT" | "DELETE" = "GET",
  data?: any,
  params?: any
): Promise<T> {
  try {
    const response = await axios({
      method,
      url: `${API_BASE_URL}/${endpoint}`,
      data,
      params,
      timeout: 30000,
      headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        "Accept": "application/json"
      }
    });
    return response.data;
  } catch (error) {
    throw error;
  }
}
```

## Async/Await Best Practices

Always use async/await for network requests and I/O operations:

```typescript
// Good: Async network request
async function fetchData(resourceId: string): Promise<ResourceData> {
  const response = await axios.get(`${API_URL}/resource/${resourceId}`);
  return response.data;
}

// Bad: Promise chains
function fetchData(resourceId: string): Promise<ResourceData> {
  return axios.get(`${API_URL}/resource/${resourceId}`)
    .then(response => response.data);  // Harder to read and maintain
}
```

## TypeScript Best Practices

1. **Use Strict TypeScript**: Enable strict mode in tsconfig.json
2. **Define Interfaces**: Create clear interface definitions for all data structures
3. **Avoid `any`**: Use proper types or `unknown` instead of `any`
4. **Zod for Runtime Validation**: Use Zod schemas to validate external data
5. **Type Guards**: Create type guard functions for complex type checking
6. **Error Handling**: Always use try-catch with proper error type checking
7. **Null Safety**: Use optional chaining (`?.`) and nullish coalescing (`??`)

```typescript
// Good: Type-safe with Zod and interfaces
interface UserResponse {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  email: string;
  team?: string;
  active: boolean;
}

const UserSchema = z.object({
  id: z.string(),
  name: z.string(),
  email: z.string().email(),
  team: z.string().optional(),
  active: z.boolean()
});

type User = z.infer<typeof UserSchema>;

async function getUser(id: string): Promise<User> {
  const data = await apiCall(`/users/${id}`);
  return UserSchema.parse(data);  // Runtime validation
}

// Bad: Using any
async function getUser(id: string): Promise<any> {
  return await apiCall(`/users/${id}`);  // No type safety
}
```

## Advanced MCP Features

### Resource Registration

Expose data as resources for efficient, URI-based access:

```typescript
import { ResourceTemplate } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/types.js";

// Register a resource with URI template
server.registerResource(
  {
    uri: "file://documents/{name}",
    name: "Document Resource",
    description: "Access documents by name",
    mimeType: "text/plain"
  },
  async (uri: string) => {
    // Extract parameter from URI
    const match = uri.match(/^file:\/\/documents\/(.+)$/);
    if (!match) {
      throw new Error("Invalid URI format");
    }

    const documentName = match[1];
    const content = await loadDocument(documentName);

    return {
      contents: [{
        uri,
        mimeType: "text/plain",
        text: content
      }]
    };
  }
);

// List available resources dynamically
server.registerResourceList(async () => {
  const documents = await getAvailableDocuments();
  return {
    resources: documents.map(doc => ({
      uri: `file://documents/${doc.name}`,
      name: doc.name,
      mimeType: "text/plain",
      description: doc.description
    }))
  };
});
```

**When to use Resources vs Tools:**
- **Resources**: For data access with simple URI-based parameters
- **Tools**: For complex operations requiring validation and business logic
- **Resources**: When data is relatively static or template-based
- **Tools**: When operations have side effects or complex workflows

### Transport Options

The TypeScript SDK supports two main transport mechanisms:

#### Streamable HTTP (Recommended for Remote Servers)

```typescript
import { StreamableHTTPServerTransport } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/streamableHttp.js";
import express from "express";

const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

app.post('/mcp', async (req, res) => {
  // Create new transport for each request (stateless, prevents request ID collisions)
  const transport = new StreamableHTTPServerTransport({
    sessionIdGenerator: undefined,
    enableJsonResponse: true
  });

  res.on('close', () => transport.close());

  await server.connect(transport);
  await transport.handleRequest(req, res, req.body);
});

app.listen(3000);
```

#### stdio (For Local Integrations)

```typescript
import { StdioServerTransport } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/stdio.js";

const transport = new StdioServerTransport();
await server.connect(transport);
```

**Transport selection:**
- **Streamable HTTP**: Web services, remote access, multiple clients
- **stdio**: Command-line tools, local development, subprocess integration

### Notification Support

Notify clients when server state changes:

```typescript
// Notify when tools list changes
server.notification({
  method: "notifications/tools/list_changed"
});

// Notify when resources change
server.notification({
  method: "notifications/resources/list_changed"
});
```

Use notifications sparingly - only when server capabilities genuinely change.

## Code Best Practices

### Code Composability and Reusability

Your implementation MUST prioritize composability and code reuse:

1. **Extract Common Functionality**:
   - Create reusable helper functions for operations used across multiple tools
   - Build shared API clients for HTTP requests instead of duplicating code
   - Centralize error handling logic in utility functions
   - Extract business logic into dedicated functions that can be composed
   - Extract shared markdown or JSON field selection & formatting functionality

2. **Avoid Duplication**:
   - NEVER copy-paste similar code between tools
   - If you find yourself writing similar logic twice, extract it into a function
   - Common operations like pagination, filtering, field selection, and formatting should be shared
   - Authentication/authorization logic should be centralized

## Building and Running

Always build your TypeScript code before running:

```bash
# Build the project
npm run build

# Run the server
npm start

# Development with auto-reload
npm run dev
```

Always ensure `npm run build` completes successfully before considering the implementation complete.

## Quality Checklist

Before finalizing your Node/TypeScript MCP server implementation, ensure:

### Strategic Design
- [ ] Tools enable complete workflows, not just API endpoint wrappers
- [ ] Tool names reflect natural task subdivisions

# Python MCP Server Implementation Guide

## Overview

This document provides Python-specific best practices and examples for implementing MCP servers using the MCP Python SDK. It covers server setup, tool registration patterns, input validation with Pydantic, error handling, and complete working examples.

---

## Quick Reference

### Key Imports
```python
from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field, field_validator, ConfigDict
from typing import Optional, List, Dict, Any
from enum import Enum
import httpx
```

### Server Initialization
```python
mcp = FastMCP("service_mcp")
```

### Tool Registration Pattern
```python
@mcp.tool(name="tool_name", annotations={...})
async def tool_function(params: InputModel) -> str:
    # Implementation
    pass
```

---

## MCP Python SDK and FastMCP

The official MCP Python SDK provides FastMCP, a high-level framework for building MCP servers. It provides:
- Automatic description and inputSchema generation from function signatures and docstrings
- Pydantic model integration for input validation
- Decorator-based tool registration with `@mcp.tool`

**For complete SDK documentation, use WebFetch to load:**
`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk/main/README.md`

## Server Naming Convention

Python MCP servers must follow this naming pattern:
- **Format**: `{service}_mcp` (lowercase with underscores)
- **Examples**: `github_mcp`, `jira_mcp`, `stripe_mcp`

The name should be:
- General (not tied to specific features)
- Descriptive of the service/API being integrated
- Easy to infer from the task description
- Without version numbers or dates

## Tool Implementation

### Tool Naming

Use snake_case for tool names (e.g., "search_users", "create_project", "get_channel_info") with clear, action-oriented names.

**Avoid Naming Conflicts**: Include the service context to prevent overlaps:
- Use "slack_send_message" instead of just "send_message"
- Use "github_create_issue" instead of just "create_issue"
- Use "asana_list_tasks" instead of just "list_tasks"

### Tool Structure with FastMCP

Tools are defined using the `@mcp.tool` decorator with Pydantic models for input validation:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field, ConfigDict
from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP

# Initialize the MCP server
mcp = FastMCP("example_mcp")

# Define Pydantic model for input validation
class ServiceToolInput(BaseModel):
    '''Input model for service tool operation.'''
    model_config = ConfigDict(
        str_strip_whitespace=True,  # Auto-strip whitespace from strings
        validate_assignment=True,    # Validate on assignment
        extra='forbid'              # Forbid extra fields
    )

    param1: str = Field(..., description="First parameter description (e.g., 'user123', 'project-abc')", min_length=1, max_length=100)
    param2: Optional[int] = Field(default=None, description="Optional integer parameter with constraints", ge=0, le=1000)
    tags: Optional[List[str]] = Field(default_factory=list, description="List of tags to apply", max_items=10)

@mcp.tool(
    name="service_tool_name",
    annotations={
        "title": "Human-Readable Tool Title",
        "readOnlyHint": True,     # Tool does not modify environment
        "destructiveHint": False,  # Tool does not perform destructive operations
        "idempotentHint": True,    # Repeated calls have no additional effect
        "openWorldHint": False     # Tool does not interact with external entities
    }
)
async def service_tool_name(params: ServiceToolInput) -> str:
    '''Tool description automatically becomes the 'description' field.

    This tool performs a specific operation on the service. It validates all inputs
    using the ServiceToolInput Pydantic model before processing.

    Args:
        params (ServiceToolInput): Validated input parameters containing:
            - param1 (str): First parameter description
            - param2 (Optional[int]): Optional parameter with default
            - tags (Optional[List[str]]): List of tags

    Returns:
        str: JSON-formatted response containing operation results
    '''
    # Implementation here
    pass
```

## Pydantic v2 Key Features

- Use `model_config` instead of nested `Config` class
- Use `field_validator` instead of deprecated `validator`
- Use `model_dump()` instead of deprecated `dict()`
- Validators require `@classmethod` decorator
- Type hints are required for validator methods

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field, field_validator, ConfigDict

class CreateUserInput(BaseModel):
    model_config = ConfigDict(
        str_strip_whitespace=True,
        validate_assignment=True
    )

    name: str = Field(..., description="User's full name", min_length=1, max_length=100)
    email: str = Field(..., description="User's email address", pattern=r'^[\w\.-]+@[\w\.-]+\.\w+$')
    age: int = Field(..., description="User's age", ge=0, le=150)

    @field_validator('email')
    @classmethod
    def validate_email(cls, v: str) -> str:
        if not v.strip():
            raise ValueError("Email cannot be empty")
        return v.lower()
```

## Response Format Options

Support multiple output formats for flexibility:

```python
from enum import Enum

class ResponseFormat(str, Enum):
    '''Output format for tool responses.'''
    MARKDOWN = "markdown"
    JSON = "json"

class UserSearchInput(BaseModel):
    query: str = Field(..., description="Search query")
    response_format: ResponseFormat = Field(
        default=ResponseFormat.MARKDOWN,
        description="Output format: 'markdown' for human-readable or 'json' for machine-readable"
    )
```

**Markdown format**:
- Use headers, lists, and formatting for clarity
- Convert timestamps to human-readable format (e.g., "2024-01-15 10:30:00 UTC" instead of epoch)
- Show display names with IDs in parentheses (e.g., "@john.doe (U123456)")
- Omit verbose metadata (e.g., show only one profile image URL, not all sizes)
- Group related information logically

**JSON format**:
- Return complete, structured data suitable for programmatic processing
- Include all available fields and metadata
- Use consistent field names and types

## Pagination Implementation

For tools that list resources:

```python
class ListInput(BaseModel):
    limit: Optional[int] = Field(default=20, description="Maximum results to return", ge=1, le=100)
    offset: Optional[int] = Field(default=0, description="Number of results to skip for pagination", ge=0)

async def list_items(params: ListInput) -> str:
    # Make API request with pagination
    data = await api_request(limit=params.limit, offset=params.offset)

    # Return pagination info
    response = {
        "total": data["total"],
        "count": len(data["items"]),
        "offset": params.offset,
        "items": data["items"],
        "has_more": data["total"] > params.offset + len(data["items"]),
        "next_offset": params.offset + len(data["items"]) if data["total"] > params.offset + len(data["items"]) else None
    }
    return json.dumps(response, indent=2)
```

## Error Handling

Provide clear, actionable error messages:

```python
def _handle_api_error(e: Exception) -> str:
    '''Consistent error formatting across all tools.'''
    if isinstance(e, httpx.HTTPStatusError):
        if e.response.status_code == 404:
            return "Error: Resource not found. Please check the ID is correct."
        elif e.response.status_code == 403:
            return "Error: Permission denied. You don't have access to this resource."
        elif e.response.status_code == 429:
            return "Error: Rate limit exceeded. Please wait before making more requests."
        return f"Error: API request failed with status {e.response.status_code}"
    elif isinstance(e, httpx.TimeoutException):
        return "Error: Request timed out. Please try again."
    return f"Error: Unexpected error occurred: {type(e).__name__}"
```

## Shared Utilities

Extract common functionality into reusable functions:

```python
# Shared API request function
async def _make_api_request(endpoint: str, method: str = "GET", **kwargs) -> dict:
    '''Reusable function for all API calls.'''
    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        response = await client.request(
            method,
            f"{API_BASE_URL}/{endpoint}",
            timeout=30.0,
            **kwargs
        )
        response.raise_for_status()
        return response.json()
```

## Async/Await Best Practices

Always use async/await for network requests and I/O operations:

```python
# Good: Async network request
async def fetch_data(resource_id: str) -> dict:
    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        response = await client.get(f"{API_URL}/resource/{resource_id}")
        response.raise_for_status()
        return response.json()

# Bad: Synchronous request
def fetch_data(resource_id: str) -> dict:
    response = requests.get(f"{API_URL}/resource/{resource_id}")  # Blocks
    return response.json()
```

## Type Hints

Use type hints throughout:

```python
from typing import Optional, List, Dict, Any

async def get_user(user_id: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    data = await fetch_user(user_id)
    return {"id": data["id"], "name": data["name"]}
```

## Tool Docstrings

Every tool must have comprehensive docstrings with explicit type information:

```python
async def search_users(params: UserSearchInput) -> str:
    '''
    Search for users in the Example system by name, email, or team.

    This tool searches across all user profiles in the Example platform,
    supporting partial matches and various search filters. It does NOT
    create or modify users, only searches existing ones.

    Args:
        params (UserSearchInput): Validated input parameters containing:
            - query (str): Search string to match against names/emails (e.g., "john", "@example.com", "team:marketing")
            - limit (Optional[int]): Maximum results to return, between 1-100 (default: 20)
            - offset (Optional[int]): Number of results to skip for pagination (default: 0)

    Returns:
        str: JSON-formatted string containing search results with the following schema:

        Success response:
        {
            "total": int,           # Total number of matches found
            "count": int,           # Number of results in this response
            "offset": int,          # Current pagination offset
            "users": [
                {
                    "id": str,      # User ID (e.g., "U123456789")
                    "name": str,    # Full name (e.g., "John Doe")
                    "email": str,   # Email address (e.g., "john@example.com")
                    "team": str     # Team name (e.g., "Marketing") - optional
                }
            ]
        }

        Error response:
        "Error: <error message>" or "No users found matching '<query>'"

    Examples:
        - Use when: "Find all marketing team members" -> params with query="team:marketing"
        - Use when: "Search for John's account" -> params with query="john"
        - Don't use when: You need to create a user (use example_create_user instead)
        - Don't use when: You have a user ID and need full details (use example_get_user instead)

    Error Handling:
        - Input validation errors are handled by Pydantic model
        - Returns "Error: Rate limit exceeded" if too many requests (429 status)
        - Returns "Error: Invalid API authentication" if API key is invalid (401 status)
        - Returns formatted list of results or "No users found matching 'query'"
    '''
```

## Advanced FastMCP Features

### Context Parameter Injection

FastMCP can automatically inject a `Context` parameter into tools for advanced capabilities like logging, progress reporting, resource reading, and user interaction:

```python
from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP, Context

mcp = FastMCP("example_mcp")

@mcp.tool()
async def advanced_search(query: str, ctx: Context) -> str:
    '''Advanced tool with context access for logging and progress.'''

    # Report progress for long operations
    await ctx.report_progress(0.25, "Starting search...")

    # Log information for debugging
    await ctx.log_info("Processing query", {"query": query, "timestamp": datetime.now()})

    # Perform search
    results = await search_api(query)
    await ctx.report_progress(0.75, "Formatting results...")

    # Access server configuration
    server_name = ctx.fastmcp.name

    return format_results(results)

@mcp.tool()
async def interactive_tool(resource_id: str, ctx: Context) -> str:
    '''Tool that can request additional input from users.'''

    # Request sensitive information when needed
    api_key = await ctx.elicit(
        prompt="Please provide your API key:",
        input_type="password"
    )

    # Use the provided key
    return await api_call(resource_id, api_key)
```

**Context capabilities:**
- `ctx.report_progress(progress, message)` - Report progress for long operations
- `ctx.log_info(message, data)` / `ctx.log_error()` / `ctx.log_debug()` - Logging
- `ctx.elicit(prompt, input_type)` - Request input from users
- `ctx.fastmcp.name` - Access server configuration
- `ctx.read_resource(uri)` - Read MCP resources

### Resource Registration

Expose data as resources for efficient, template-based access:

```python
@mcp.resource("file://documents/{name}")
async def get_document(name: str) -> str:
    '''Expose documents as MCP resources.

    Resources are useful for static or semi-static data that doesn't
    require complex parameters. They use URI templates for flexible access.
    '''
    document_path = f"./docs/{name}"
    with open(document_path, "r") as f:
        return f.read()

@mcp.resource("config://settings/{key}")
async def get_setting(key: str, ctx: Context) -> str:
    '''Expose configuration as resources with context.'''
    settings = await load_settings()
    return json.dumps(settings.get(key, {}))
```

**When to use Resources vs Tools:**
- **Resources**: For data access with simple parameters (URI templates)
- **Tools**: For complex operations with validation and business logic

### Structured Output Types

FastMCP supports multiple return types beyond strings:

```python
from typing import TypedDict
from dataclasses import dataclass
from pydantic import BaseModel

# TypedDict for structured returns
class UserData(TypedDict):
    id: str
    name: str
    email: str

@mcp.tool()
async def get_user_typed(user_id: str) -> UserData:
    '''Returns structured data - FastMCP handles serialization.'''
    return {"id": user_id, "name": "John Doe", "email": "john@example.com"}

# Pydantic models for complex validation
class DetailedUser(BaseModel):
    id: str
    name: str
    email: str
    created_at: datetime
    metadata: Dict[str, Any]

@mcp.tool()
async def get_user_detailed(user_id: str) -> DetailedUser:
    '''Returns Pydantic model - automatically generates schema.'''
    user = await fetch_user(user_id)
    return DetailedUser(**user)
```

### Lifespan Management

Initialize resources that persist across requests:

```python
from contextlib import asynccontextmanager

@asynccontextmanager
async def app_lifespan():
    '''Manage resources that live for the server's lifetime.'''
    # Initialize connections, load config, etc.
    db = await connect_to_database()
    config = load_configuration()

    # Make available to all tools
    yield {"db": db, "config": config}

    # Cleanup on shutdown
    await db.close()

mcp = FastMCP("example_mcp", lifespan=app_lifespan)

@mcp.tool()
async def query_data(query: str, ctx: Context) -> str:
    '''Access lifespan resources through context.'''
    db = ctx.request_context.lifespan_state["db"]
    results = await db.query(query)
    return format_results(results)
```

### Transport Options

FastMCP supports two main transport mechanisms:

```python
# stdio transport (for local tools) - default
if __name__ == "__main__":
    mcp.run()

# Streamable HTTP transport (for remote servers)
if __name__ == "__main__":
    mcp.run(transport="streamable_http", port=8000)
```

**Transport selection:**
- **stdio**: Command-line tools, local integrations, subprocess execution
- **Streamable HTTP**: Web services, remote access, multiple clients

---

## Code Best Practices

### Code Composability and Reusability

Your implementation MUST prioritize composability and code reuse:

1. **Extract Common Functionality**:
   - Create reusable helper functions for operations used across multiple tools
   - Build shared API clients for HTTP requests instead of duplicating code
   - Centralize error handling logic in utility functions
   - Extract business logic into dedicated functions that can be composed
   - Extract shared markdown or JSON field selection & formatting functionality

2. **Avoid Duplication**:
   - NEVER copy-paste similar code between tools
   - If you find yourself writing similar logic twice, extract it into a function
   - Common operations like pagination, filtering, field selection, and formatting should be shared
   - Authentication/authorization logic should be centralized

### Python-Specific Best Practices

1. **Use Type Hints**: Always include type annotations for function parameters and return values
2. **Pydantic Models**: Define clear Pydantic models for all input validation
3. **Avoid Manual Validation**: Let Pydantic handle input validation with constraints
4. **Proper Imports**: Group imports (standard library, third-party, local)
5. **Error Handling**: Use specific exception types (httpx.HTTPStatusError, not generic Exception)
6. **Async Context Managers**: Use `async with` for resources that need cleanup
7. **Constants**: Define module-level constants in UPPER_CASE
